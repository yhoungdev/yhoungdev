### Hi there üëã

I'm a developer with a strong interest in **Linux, open-source software, and low-level systems**. Most days, you'll find me immersed in code, exploring new ideas and bringing them to life. When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing drums and diving into deep reads.

### Tech & Interests

My journey with **Linux** has been diverse. While I started with **Ubuntu**, I've explored various distributions like **Kali Linux, Parrot OS, Lubuntu, and Tails**. Although I often find myself "trying" **Arch Linux**, I currently rely on **macOS** for its impressive battery life. Lately, I've been focusing on **Rust**, and I even dabbled in running a **Bitcoin node** on a Raspberry Pi 4 (it was an interesting experiment, to say the least!).

I was a **Solana Summer Fellow '24**, where I gained hands-on experience building on the **Solana blockchain**. My interest in **decentralized technologies** remains strong.
