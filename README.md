### Hi there üëã

`I'm a developer with a strong interest in Linux, open-source software, and low-level systems. Most days, you'll find me immersed in code, exploring new ideas and bringing them to life. When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing drums and diving into deep reads.`

```I'm currently seeking new job opportunities. üíº```



### Tech & Interests

> My journey with **Linux** has been diverse. While I started with **Ubuntu**, I've explored various distributions like **Kali Linux, Parrot OS, Lubuntu, and Tails**. I currently rely on **macOS** for its impressive battery life. Lately (OS/Kernel wise i prefer Linux), I've been focusing on **Rust**, and I even dabbled in running a **Bitcoin node** on a Raspberry Pi 4 (it was an interesting experiment, to say the least!).
